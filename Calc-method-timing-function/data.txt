1. âœ… calc() method in CSS
The calc() function is used to perform calculations directly in CSS property values. Itâ€™s helpful when you need to combine different units (like %, px, em, etc.) or do simple math.

syntax ->

width: calc(100% - 50px);

Example ->

.container {
  width: calc(100% - 40px);
  height: calc(50vh + 100px);
  margin-left: calc(10px + 2%);
}

Repeat timing function in CSS (Animation/Transition)
There's no property called "repeat timing function", but you might be referring to animation timing and repeating animations.

ðŸ”¹ animation-iteration-count â€” controls how many times the animation repeats.

animation-iteration-count: infinite; /* repeats forever */
animation-iteration-count: 3; /* repeats 3 times */

* animation-timing-function â€” controls the speed curve of the animation.

animation-timing-function: ease;      /* default */
animation-timing-function: linear;    /* same speed throughout */
animation-timing-function: ease-in;   /* slow at start */
animation-timing-function: ease-out;  /* slow at end */
animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;

ðŸ“Œ Example:

@keyframes slide {
  from { transform: translateX(0); }
  to { transform: translateX(100px); }
}

.box {
  animation-name: slide;
  animation-duration: 2s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}

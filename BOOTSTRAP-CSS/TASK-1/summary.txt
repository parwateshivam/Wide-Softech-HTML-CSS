A **CSS library** is a **collection of pre-written CSS code** that developers can use to style websites quickly, without writing everything from scratch.

Instead of writing custom styles for every button, layout, or text style, these libraries provide **ready-made classes** that can be reused easily.

2. Why Use CSS Libraries?

### Without a CSS Library:

* You have to manually write all styles (margin, padding, buttons, grids, responsiveness).
* It’s time-consuming.
* It lacks consistency unless you plan carefully.

### With a CSS Library:

* You use **predefined utility classes** or **components**.
* Your design is **mobile-friendly**, **responsive**, and **consistent** by default.
* You **save time**, especially on layout and styling.

✅ Use Case:

* Good for beginners or quick MVP development.
* Ideal when you want **pre-styled components**.

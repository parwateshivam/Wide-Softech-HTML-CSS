### 📐 What is `aspect-ratio` in CSS?

The `aspect-ratio` property in CSS is used to **control the width-to-height ratio** of an element — especially useful for responsive design and media like images, videos, or containers.

---

### ✅ Syntax:

```css
aspect-ratio: width / height;
```

### 🔢 Examples:

```css
.box {
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;  /* widescreen shape */
}

.square {
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;   /* perfect square */
}

.portrait {
  aspect-ratio: 3 / 4;   /* taller than wide */
}
```

---

### 📌 Key Points:

* It **reserves space** based on the ratio, even **before content loads** (like images).
* Helps create **responsive layouts** without needing to calculate height manually.
* Works best when **width or height is constrained** (e.g., with `width: 100%`).

---

### 💡 Example:

```css
.card {
  width: 300px;
  aspect-ratio: 4 / 3;
  background: lightblue;
}
```

This will create a box 300px wide and 225px high (300 × 3 ÷ 4 = 225).

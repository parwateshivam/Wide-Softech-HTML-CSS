### 📚 How Does It Work?

The internet works by connecting computers through a network using:

* **Servers** – Special computers that store websites, files, and apps.
* **Clients** – Devices like your phone or laptop that access data from servers.
* **IP Addresses** – Unique numbers that identify each device on the network.
